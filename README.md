# walking-is-falling

Body sensor personal devices with 
gyroscopes appear to need to record 
constantly (not realistic at this time)
or have one or more extra reads for 
them to actually be useful as fall 
detection devices.

1 Inclusive of all falling tupes would 
be ultimate goal, reasonable goal is 
best simplified accurate fall detection,
not necessarily for subscription service
or lease.
